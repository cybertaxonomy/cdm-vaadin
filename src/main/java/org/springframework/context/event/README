This package contains the PojoEventListenerManager which manages the event listerner methods in mvp popup presenter instances. 
Presenter instances are created in turn of the calls to NavigationManagerBean.findPopupView()
The PojoEventListenerManager creates ApplicationListener instances for each method annotated with @EventListner 
and adds them to the EventMulticaster.

These classes are locate in this spring package to allow the PojoEventListenerManager using the 
org.springframework.context.event.EventExpressionEvaluator class wich is otherwise not visible.
