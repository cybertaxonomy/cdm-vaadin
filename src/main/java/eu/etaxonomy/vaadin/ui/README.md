# Vaadin UI Framework

*A spring based UI framework for Vaadin which brings a responsive menu layout and popup editors with easy data binding* 

This framework is based on an idea of Peter Letho from Vaadin which has been presented as 
["Supporting mobile, desktop and tablet by building impressive layout systems"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKJ7tkLS8XE). 
The according source code is here https://github.com/peterl1084/devday2016" a the Vaadin DevDay 2016. The original framework 
was using Java Web Beans (CDI) which has been ported to Spring DI for this project.
